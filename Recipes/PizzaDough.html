    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups sprouted spelt flour, or as needed, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (100 to 105 degrees F/38 to 41 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the bowl</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk 1 cup flour, water, honey, and yeast together in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and mixture is bubbly, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir remaining 2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt into yeast mixture. Beat in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, adding more flour as necessary, until a soft and tacky dough forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Place dough into an oiled mixing bowl, cover the bowl with a plate, and let rise until doubled in volume, 90 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Punch dough down and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Divide into four equal balls. Cover each ball and let rest until dough rises slightly, 30 to 45 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
